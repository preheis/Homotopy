Homotopy Algorithm for Symmetric Eigenvalue Problems

The homotopy method is an algorithm for solving eigenvalue and eigenvector problems. This program solves for the eigenpairs for real symmetric tridiagonal matrices. The algorithm differs from other eigenvalue algorithms because we can compute specific eigenvalues for a matrix, rather than computing all eigenvalues of the matrix.
